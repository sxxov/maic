# `maic`

Material Design Icons by Google, in a tree-shakable, SVG string, ESModule form. Based off of [`@material-design-icons/svg`](https://github.com/marella/material-design-icons/tree/main/svg), & automatically updates via GitHub Actions.

```svelte
<script>

## Structure

The structure of importables are as so:

```
┌/maic
└─┬/{variant}
  └──/ic_{icon}
```

**`{variant}`** & **`{icon}`** correspond to the variant (eg. `filled`, `outline`, `rounded`, `sharp`, `two_tone`) of the icon, & the icon font ligature (eg. `done`, `search`, `settings`), respectfully. See the full list of both on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) or [`@material-design-icons/svg`'s demo](https://marella.me/material-design-icons/demo/svg).

This structure is exposed both in the module exported paths, as well as each level's import. This enables, but is not limited to, the following patterns:

#### Example

```js
import * as maic from 'maic';
import { filled } from 'maic';
import * as filled from 'maic/filled';
import { ic_done } from 'maic/filled';
import ic_done from 'maic/filled/done';
```


> ❗**Caveat 1**
> 
> Unlike the folder structure found in [`@material-design-icons/svg`](https://github.com/marella/material-design-icons/tree/main/svg), **`{variant}`** s here are [`snake_cased`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) rather than `kebab-cased` (eg. `two-tone` is cased as `two_tone`).
>
> For more info, see [ESM compatibility](#esm-compatibility).

> ❗**Caveat 2**
> 
> **`{icon}`** s are always prefixed with `ic_` (eg. `import done from 'ic_done'`).
>
> For more info, see [ESM compatibility](#esm-compatibility).

## Usage

Before you start using `maic`, ensure your bundler, import loader, or simply your JavaScript environment, performs NodeJS-style module resolution. This is the default for most popular bundlers, but you may have to enable it manually, [even for NodeJS itself](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--experimental-specifier-resolutionmode).
If you aren't able to modify such a setting, you may have to modify your import specifiers (see below).

After that, simply use one of the import strategies below:

### Variant-level import

Import the variant, & get access to each icon individually through named imports.

> ℹ️ **Hint**
>
> This is the **recommended** way of using `maic`, as it balances terseness with tree-shakability.
>
> For more info, see [Tree-shaking](#tree-shaking).

#### Example

```js
import { ic_1k_plus } from 'maic/filled';
//       ^ '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" ...'
```

> ℹ️ **Hint**
>
> If you're having trouble importing & you're not using NodeJS-style imports, try appending `/index.js` to the end of the import specifier (eg. `maic/filled` → `maic/filled/index.js`).

### Icon-level import

Import only a specific icon, & gain access to it through a default import.

> Use this when you're not using a bundler, or one that doesn't support [tree-shaking](#tree-shaking).
> Also use this you're using [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) (eg. `await import('maic/filled/ic_1k_plus')`).
>
> For more info, see [Tree-shaking](#tree-shaking).

```js
import ic_1k_plus from 'maic/filled/ic_1k_plus';
//     ^ '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" ...'
```

> ℹ️ **Hint**
>
> If you're having trouble importing & you're not using NodeJS-style imports, try appending `.js` to the end of the import specifier (eg. `maic/filled/ic_1k_plus` → `maic/filled/ic_1k_plus.js`).

### Top-level import

Import the whole module, & gain access to variants, with their respective icons inside.

> **⚠️ Warning**
> 
> Use this with caution! as to not "leak" the imported SVGs into un-tree-shakable contexts (such as cloning the immutable module object into a mutable, regular, JavaScript object)
>
> For more info, see [Tree-shaking](#tree-shaking).

#### Example

```js
import { filled } from 'maic';
//	     ^ {
//		        ic_1k_plus: '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/...',
//		        ic_1k: '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" ...',
//		        ...
//	       }
```

## Usage notes

### `vite`/`rollup` builds

To speed up development reloads when using `vite`/`rollup`, you may use the `maic/helper` plugin like below to only import the required icons during development.

#### Example

```js
// vite/rollup.config.js
import maicHelper from 'maic/helper';

export default {
	plugins: [
		maicHelper({
			enabled: !process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
		}),
	],
};
```

### `EMFILE` errors on platforms with low file descriptor limits (i.e. Vercel)

`maic` is a large module, having a file for each icon, for each variant. On certain build pipelines, treeshaking doesn't apply for SSR builds & they leak overly wide `maic` imports, such as `import {} from 'maic'`, causing runtimes to load the entire `maic` library & crashing. In this case, using `maic/helper` for both the development & production build may help.


#### Example

```js
// vite/rollup.config.js
import maicHelper from 'maic/helper';

export default {
	plugins: [
		maicHelper(),
	],
};
```

### Tree-shaking

The assumption of a working, tree-shaking-capable bundles is the crux of why this module can even exist. `maic` utilises the fact that any code that is not imported, or is imported & not used, will be shed away in modern bundlers. This enables `maic` to lump the (surprisingly massive) collection of Material Design Icon SVGs into a few JavaScript files & call it a day.

...Somewhat.

Unfortunately, tree-shaking in the JavaScript ecosystem is often fragile. This is due to the dynamism of JavaScript's interpreted nature. You can do _really nasty things_ to access & assign properties (eg. `eval`). Due to this bundlers have a relatively limited scope of when & where tree-shaking happens. The gist of import-related rules are as follows:

* ✔️ Import maps
	* (eg. `import { ic_done } from 'maic/filled'`)
* ✔️ Immutable imported objects
	* (eg. `import * as filled from 'maic/filled'`)
* ❌ Dynamic imports
	* (eg. `const { ic_done } = await import('maic')`)

In the situations where tree-shaking doesn't kick in, you may want to consider using only [icon-level imports](#icon-level-import), or [`vite`/`rollup` hot reloads](#viterollup-hot-reloads). However, if the problem permuates through your codebase, a build chain refactor is commonly the only way out.

### ESM compatibility

There have been a few changes that were carried out to enable ESM compatibility:

* Transforming `kebab-cased` folder names to [`snake_cased`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
	* (eg. `two-tone` is not a valid JavaScript identifier, as the hyphen is the subtraction operator)
* Appending the `ic_` prefix to every icon
	* (eg. `1k` is not a valid JavaScript identifier, as it starts with a number)

Both of these choices were made to allow imports to be consistent across folder structures & ESModule imports.

#### Example

```js
// `two_tone` can be imported & is consistent with directory imports
// the `ic_` prefix appears everywhere instead of only certain places

import { ic_1k } from 'maic/filled';
import ic_1k_plus from 'maic/filled/ic_1k_plus';
import { two_tone } from 'maic';
import { ic_1x_mobiledata } from 'maic/two_tone';
import ic_2k_plus from 'maic/two_tone/ic_2k_plus';
```

## Package notes

### Versioning

The sematic version of `maic` is linked to [`@material-design-icons`](https://github.com/marella/material-design-icons/tree/main/svg)'s.
Any hotfixes to `maic` itself, orthogonal to the version of icons it depends on, will be appended to the end of the version (eg. the first fix for [`@material-design-icons@0.12.1`](https://github.com/marella/material-design-icons/releases/tag/v0.12.1) will be `maic@0.12.1-1`).

### Building

The only prerequisites is having `npm` & `NodeJS` installed. Run the following to build the `maic` workspace, & publish it to `npm`:

```bash
npm run build
npm run publish
```
